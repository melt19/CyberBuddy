# CyberBuddy - A Digital Phishing Assistant

CyberBuddy is designed to fill the gap between spam filters, anti-virus and phishing protection training. It is a Chrome extension who passively checks each website you visit and lets you know if the site is phishy! 

Important Note: If using this extension, you'll need your own Google SafeBrowsing API key, and put it into the buddy.js file.
